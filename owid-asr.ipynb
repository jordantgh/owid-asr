        "This report calculates and compares death rates from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Uganda and the United States in 2019. Steps taken were to ingest and filter datasets, calculate crude death rates, and then calculate age standardised death rates. All death rates are reported as deaths per 100,000 population. The crude death rates are 5.8 in Uganda and 57.2 in the United States, perhaps surprisingly since Uganda has higher mortality in each age group. However, after adjusting for the age distribution of the population, the COPD death rates in Uganda and the United States are very similar, at 28.7 and 28.4 respectively. This is because the United States has a much older population than Uganda, and COPD is primarily a disease of the elderly. Even though the death rates in Uganda are an *order of magnitude higher* for younger age groups, these are very small portion of all COPD deaths. The mortality signal remains dominated by over 50s in the age standardised data, and in these groups death rates are similar in both countries.\n",
